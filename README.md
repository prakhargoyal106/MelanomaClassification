# Using CNN for Melanoma Classification

This project is build for binary classification of Melanoma (Skin Cancer) in images of skin lesions. Melanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.

## Built Using

* Pytorch
* Pre-trained EfficientNet-b1

## Future Work

* Introduce new machine learning optimization techniques to improve model accuracy
* Add more Data Augmentation strategy for better generalization of model
